# ThirdTime
Third Time Tracker app that enables easy, simple use of this amazing productivity method!
Third Time is a productivity method that alternates between work and break blocks similar to Pomodoro. It is much more flexible and effective than pomodoro though! Work for as long as you like, then take a break for 1/3 the amount of time you worked for. This app features a stop watch for work blocks, automatic 1/3 ratio timer for breaks, settings that allow you to adjust the ratio, and more! Its sleek, beautiful UI is something you won't mind keeping on your screen while you work.
